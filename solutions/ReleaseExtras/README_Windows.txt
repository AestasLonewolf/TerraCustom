Install Instructions: Copy the "TerraCustom vX.Y.Z.exe" file to the Terraria install folder, 

To Run: Run the TerraCustom vX.Y.Z.exe file

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Terraria"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder. If you can't find it, view this video: https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantAssuredIsabellineshrike

  GOG: Wherever you put it, likely "C:\GOG Games\Terrariaâ€‹"

If you see an error mentioning "System.DllNotFoundException" or "ReLogic.Native.dll", you didn't install in the correct folder.

Note: "C:\Documents\My Games\Terraria\" is NOT your install folder, it is your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed in the install folder to work.

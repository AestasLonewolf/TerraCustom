Install Instructions: Copy all the files from this zip to the Terraria install folder. Then, you'll need to give execute permissions to the TerraCustom file. To do this, open a terminal in the install directory and run this command:
    chmod +x TerraCustom

To Run: Run the TerraCustom file (not TerraCustom.exe)

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: ".local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder.

  GOG: Wherever you put it

If you see an error mentioning "System.DllNotFoundException" or "ReLogic.Native.dll", you didn't install in the correct folder.

Note: "~/.local/share/Terraria" or "$XDG_DATA_HOME/Terraria" are NOT your install folder, they are your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed in the install folder to work.

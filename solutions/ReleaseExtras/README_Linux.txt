Install Instructions: Copy the "TerraCustom vX.Y.Z.exe" file to the Terraria install folder. 
To Run: Rename "Terraria.exe" to "Terraria_original.exe" and then rename "TerraCustom vX.Y.Z.exe" to "Terraria.exe". Then Run Terraria as you normally do. Be sure to reverse the process after to revert back to vanilla Terraria when done.

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: ".local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder.

  GOG: Wherever you put it

If you see an error mentioning "System.DllNotFoundException" or "ReLogic.Native.dll", you didn't install in the correct folder.

Note: "~/.local/share/Terraria" or "$XDG_DATA_HOME/Terraria" are NOT your install folder, they are your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed in the install folder to work.

Install Instructions: Copy all the files from this zip to the Terraria install folder.

To Run: Run the TerraCustom file (not TerraCustom.exe)

If it doesn't run, you might need to give execute permissions to the TerraCustom file. To do this, open a terminal in the install directory and run this command:
    chmod +x TerraCustom

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: "Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria/Terraria.app/Contents/MacOS"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder. If you can't find it, view this video: https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantAssuredIsabellineshrike

  GOG: Wherever you put it

If you see an error mentioning "System.DllNotFoundException" or "ReLogic.Native.dll", you didn't install in the correct folder.

Note: "/Users/account/Library/Application Support/Terraria" is NOT your install folder, it is your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed in the install folder to work.
